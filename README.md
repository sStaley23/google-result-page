Attempting to recreate a google result page.  This is the second exercise after completing the css/html lessons in the WebDev 101 section. 




Progress notes:

2019 Sep 18 - Working on positioning the web results; right now one is ontop of the other because they share the same class which has absolute poistioning...
Also need to change out the text for the second batch of web results. video jibberish was added as an attempt to force the second group down but did not work

2019 Sep 19 - working on first featured, getting the bttom information straight then buttoning up the fonts and final positions. Then onto the first results section

2019 Sep 20 - got the first result, now i need to work on video section and the spacing between the results and video sections. 

2019 Sep 24 - finished video section, now working on spacing between sections. Then on to people also asked box. 

2019 Sep 25 - working on "People also asked" collapsible. Left off trying to get it to transition open correctly, then remove blue border when active, and then I need to add arrow. 

2019 Sep 26 - Need to go back and work on the "people also asked" collapsible transition speed, right now with it at the bottom of the page it is difficult to gauge.
