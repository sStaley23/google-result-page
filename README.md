The Odin Project - HTML/CSS exercise

Attempting to recreate a google result page.  This is the second exercise after completing the css/html lessons in the WebDev 101 section. 

Things I have skipped:
	* Transition speed of the "people also asked" collapsible
	* The Gooooooooogle navigation at the bottom of the screen
	* Forgot feedback snip under "people also asked"
	* Scroll right function for the video section
	* Expansion of bottom "people also asked" for additional content
	* Option buttons, hold active status (blue bottom border and rainbow font)
